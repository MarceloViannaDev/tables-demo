## Project Description:

This project is a work in progress that utilizes table manipulation and the react-flow library. It was created for the purpose of exploring the functionality of the react-flow library. The react-flow library is a highly customizable React component for building interactive graphs and node-based editors.

Work in progress... I'm just testing stuff when I have the time...
